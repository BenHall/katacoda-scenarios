We can now use docknet to run the new project, in this case "Hello World". 

First we need to download the Nuget dependencies with `docknet restore`{{execute}}. 

Our application can now be launching using `docknet run`{{execute}}

The result is the ability to use the dotnet CLI regardless of the Linux Distro you're running.
